# State-Aware Trading System Documentation

## Overview
The State-Aware Trading System uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and unsupervised learning to identify market states and dynamically adjust trading signals. Instead of using predefined market states, the system learns market characteristics directly from the data.

## Key Components

### 1. Market State Identification
The system uses several features to identify market states:
- Volatility (20-day rolling standard deviation of returns)
- Trend Strength (based on price momentum and moving average crossovers)
- Volume (normalized relative to moving average)
- Return Dispersion (interquartile range of returns)

These features are processed through:
1. Standardization (zero mean, unit variance)
2. PCA (dimension reduction)
3. K-means clustering (state identification)

### 2. Dynamic Technical Indicators
Technical indicators are adjusted based on the statistical properties of each state:

#### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- Thresholds determined by historical percentiles
- Weight adjusted based on volatility and trend strength
- More sensitive in low-volatility states

#### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Signal threshold scaled by historical standard deviation
- Weight increases with trend strength
- More sensitive in trending states

#### Stochastic Oscillator
- Thresholds adjusted based on state volatility
- Weight scaled by market characteristics
- More reliable in range-bound conditions

### 3. Signal Generation
Trading signals are generated using:
1. State-adjusted indicator thresholds
2. Dynamic weighting based on state characteristics
3. Confidence scaling using volume and state stability

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage
```python
from market_analysis import MarketAnalyzer
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = MarketAnalyzer('AAPL')

# Fetch data
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=365)
analyzer.fetch_data(start_date, end_date)

# Generate signals
signals = analyzer.generate_trading_signals()

# Access results
print(f"Composite Signal: {signals['composite_signal']}")
print(f"Signal Confidence: {signals['confidence']}")
```

### Visualization
```python
# Create comprehensive analysis plots
fig = analyzer.plot_analysis(show_states=True, show_signals=True)

# Access individual plots
analyzer._plot_pca_components(ax)  # PCA space visualization
analyzer._plot_state_characteristics(ax)  # State feature comparison
analyzer._plot_trading_signals(ax)  # Signals with confidence bands
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Adjusting State Sensitivity
```python
# Modify number of states
analyzer.identify_market_states(n_states=4)  # Default is 3

# Adjust historical window for dynamic thresholds
historical_window = 100  # Default
```

### Custom Indicator Configurations
The system supports custom indicator configurations through the `technical_indicators.py` configuration file:

```python
# Example: Adjusting base configuration
config = {
    'rsi': {
        'threshold_percentile': 90,  # More extreme thresholds
        'weight': 1.0
    },
    'macd': {
        'threshold_std': 1.5,  # Higher signal threshold
        'weight': 1.2
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**
   - Use sufficient historical data (minimum 1 year recommended)
   - Ensure consistent data frequency
   - Handle missing data appropriately

2. **State Analysis**
   - Review PCA components to understand state drivers
   - Monitor state transition frequency
   - Validate state characteristics

3. **Signal Generation**
   - Consider confidence levels when taking positions
   - Monitor state stability
   - Use position sizing based on confidence

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track signal accuracy by state
   - Monitor threshold adaptability
   - Evaluate state identification stability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Unstable States**
   - Increase historical data window
   - Adjust feature calculation parameters
   - Review market volatility conditions

2. **Low Confidence Signals**
   - Check volume conditions
   - Review state stability
   - Validate indicator configurations

3. **Rapid State Transitions**
   - Increase smoothing parameters
   - Review feature calculation windows
   - Adjust number of states
