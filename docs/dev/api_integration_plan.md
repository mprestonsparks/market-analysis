# Market Analysis API Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased development plan for integrating the Market Analysis tool with external systems through a robust API layer, focusing on high-performance real-time data streaming and scalability.

## Development Philosophy
We are following an incremental development approach where each phase is thoroughly tested and validated before moving to the next. This ensures a stable and reliable foundation for more complex features.

## Architecture Components
- **FastAPI**: Main API framework
- **Redis**: Caching and rate limiting (Phase 3)
- **RabbitMQ**: Message queue for reliable data streaming (Phase 4)
- **Docker**: Containerization and orchestration

## Phase 1: Core API Infrastructure 
**Objective**: Establish core API infrastructure with essential functionality.

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Implemented FastAPI application structure
- [x] Created health check endpoint
- [x] Added CORS middleware
- [x] Implemented configuration management
- [x] Set up comprehensive test suite
- [x] Configured Docker development environment
- [x] Added CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Phase 2: Domain Models and Basic Endpoints 
**Objective**: Implement core business logic and data models.

### Tasks
1. **Data Models**
   - Create Pydantic models for market data
   - Define analysis result models
   - Implement request/response schemas
   - Add model validation

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Implement market data endpoints
   - Add analysis endpoints
   - Create results retrieval endpoints
   - Add error handling

3. **Testing**
   - Add model validation tests
   - Create endpoint integration tests
   - Implement error handling tests
   - Add performance benchmarks

## Phase 3: Caching and Rate Limiting
**Objective**: Optimize performance and add request management.

### Tasks
1. **Redis Integration**
   - Set up Redis connection
   - Implement caching strategy
   - Add cache invalidation
   - Create rate limiting middleware

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add response caching
   - Implement request deduplication
   - Create cache warming system
   - Add monitoring metrics

## Phase 4: Async Processing
**Objective**: Add support for long-running operations.

### Tasks
1. **RabbitMQ Integration**
   - Set up message queue
   - Implement async workers
   - Add job status tracking
   - Create retry mechanisms

2. **WebSocket Support**
   - Add real-time updates
   - Implement connection management
   - Create client notification system
   - Add heartbeat monitoring

## Testing Strategy
Each phase includes:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for endpoints
- Performance benchmarks
- Error handling validation

## Documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Integration guides
- Performance recommendations
- Error handling guidelines
