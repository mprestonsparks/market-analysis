I’ll analyze the data models, API patterns, and operational concerns across major trading and crypto providers like IBKR, Binance, Coinbase, Alpaca, and others. Then I’ll propose a unified DAG file and folder structure that scales cleanly across ingestion, execution, transformation, and analytics, taking into account asset types, provider distinctions, and common workflow patterns.

I’ll let you know once the restructuring proposal is ready.

# Restructuring DAG Naming and Organization for Multi-Provider Trading Workflows

## Introduction 
Managing data pipelines across **multiple trading and crypto providers** can become complex as new asset classes and services are added. The goal is to define a **scalable, future-proof directory structure and naming convention** for DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) files that handle data ingestion, trade execution, data transformation, and analytics. We want an organization that easily scales to new providers (both traditional brokers and crypto exchanges), supports all workflow domains (ingestion through analytics), and maintains **consistency across asset types** (e.g. crypto vs. equities) without being tied to legacy structures or team-specific silos. This report analyzes how major providers like **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)**, **Binance**, **Coinbase**, and **Alpaca** organize their data and APIs across asset classes, and then proposes an optimal DAG directory hierarchy and naming scheme. 

## Provider Data Structures and API Patterns 

Understanding how each provider handles different asset classes and workflows informs our unified design. Below we summarize key patterns for major providers:

### Interactive Brokers (IBKR) – Unified Multi-Asset Model 
Interactive Brokers is a traditional broker supporting **many asset classes** (stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds, crypto, etc.). Its API uses a *unified contract model* where each instrument is defined by a **security type code** (`secType`) along with other identifiers ([TWS API v9.72+: Contract Class Reference](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/classIBApi_1_1Contract.html#:~:text=string%C2%A0SecType%60%20,mutual%20fund)). For example, `secType="STK"` for stocks, `"OPT"` for options, `"FUT"` for futures, `"CASH"` for forex, and even `"CRYPTO"` for cryptocurrencies in newer versions ([TWS API v9.72+: Contract Class Reference](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/classIBApi_1_1Contract.html#:~:text=string%C2%A0SecType%60%20,mutual%20fund)). This means IBKR’s API organizes all assets under common data structures (the **Contract** object) distinguished by type fields, rather than entirely separate endpoints per asset class. 

However, IBKR’s API has unique operational considerations. It offers both a low-level **TWS API** (requiring a running gateway or Trader Workstation client) and a newer **Client Portal Web API**. Not all asset classes are available in the Web API (for instance, one source notes the IBKR Web API currently *only reliably supports equities* trading, with other asset classes requiring the TWS API) ([Interactive Brokers | Documentation](https://docs.traderspost.io/docs/core-concepts/brokers/interactive-brokers#:~:text=Supported%20Asset%20Classes)). The IBKR API can also be **stateful and rate-limited** – it has a daily server reset window (~23:45–00:45 ET) during which the API is unavailable ([Interactive Brokers | Documentation](https://docs.traderspost.io/docs/core-concepts/brokers/interactive-brokers#:~:text=Daily%20Reset)), and it processes orders sequentially per account (no parallel order placement) ([Interactive Brokers | Documentation](https://docs.traderspost.io/docs/core-concepts/brokers/interactive-brokers#:~:text=Synchronous%20Trade%20Execution)). Market data retrieval from IB can be unreliable or delayed at times, necessitating fallbacks to alternate data sources ([Interactive Brokers | Documentation](https://docs.traderspost.io/docs/core-concepts/brokers/interactive-brokers#:~:text=Market%20Data%20Quotes)). These considerations imply that **ingestion DAGs** for IBKR may need scheduling around market hours and downtime, and **execution DAGs** must handle pacing (one order at a time) and error retries. 

*Key pattern:* IBKR provides a **unified interface for multiple asset classes** (via the contract object model), so internally everything from equities to futures is handled in a similar structured way ([TWS API v9.72+: Contract Class Reference](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/classIBApi_1_1Contract.html#:~:text=string%C2%A0SecType%60%20,mutual%20fund)). This suggests our DAG design for IBKR can be unified by provider, with differentiation by asset type happening via parameters or naming, rather than completely separate logic silos.

### Binance – Segmented by Market Type 
Binance is a crypto exchange that offers a variety of trading products – **spot trading**, **margin trading**, **perpetual futures**, **delivery futures**, and even options. Binance’s API is segmented by these product lines. There are distinct base endpoints and data streams for spot (and margin) versus futures (and options). For example, Binance has separate REST API endpoints for spot (`api.binance.com/api/v3`) and futures (`fapi.binance.com` for USDT-margined futures, `dapi.binance.com` for coin-margined futures), each with their own documentation. Binance itself advertises that it offers APIs for “Spot, Margin, Futures, and Options” trading under one ecosystem ([Binance APIs](https://docs.binance.us/#introduction)) – but effectively these are distinct **API namespaces** even if one API key can access multiple segments. Market data and order execution are handled per segment. For instance, **symbol naming** differs by asset type (e.g. spot symbols like `BTCUSDT` vs. futures symbols like `BTCUSDT_210625` for an expiry). 

Operationally, Binance runs 24/7 (with occasional maintenance windows), and ingestion of market data can be continuous. There are strict **rate limits** on API calls and heavier usage may require using WebSocket streams for real-time data. **Workflow separation is inherent** – one typically has separate data ingestion processes for spot vs futures (possibly using different endpoints or stream connections), and separate order execution processes for each market type as well. 

*Key pattern:* Binance organizes data **by product/market type**, not in one unified feed. This suggests our pipeline structure should accommodate sub-categories under a provider for each asset class or market type (e.g. separate DAGs for Binance spot data vs Binance futures data) to reflect the API structure.

### Coinbase – Crypto Spot and Emerging Derivatives 
Coinbase (specifically Coinbase’s exchange/advanced trading API) historically focused on **crypto spot trading**. All assets were cryptocurrencies, so data was organized by trading pairs (e.g. BTC-USD). Recently, Coinbase introduced **perpetual futures** for crypto on its platform (through Coinbase Advanced Trade). They emphasize a unified interface where users can access *“crypto futures and spot trading through one integrated… interface.”* ([Coinbase | Trade Crypto Futures | Ethereum & Bitcoin Futures](https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/crypto-futures#:~:text=An%20intuitive%20trading%20experience)). On the backend, Coinbase’s Advanced Trade API now supports both spot and perpetual futures products via dedicated endpoints ([Advanced Trade Perpetual Futures - Coinbase Docs](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/docs/perpetuals/#:~:text=The%20Advanced%20Trade%20API%20supports,for%20users%20in%20eligible%20regions)). For example, there are endpoints for placing futures orders and checking futures positions, separate from spot endpoints, though under the same “Advanced Trade API” umbrella (for eligible users). 

In practice, Coinbase’s data structure for spot markets is straightforward (each product is a crypto pair). Futures are separate instruments (often called “contracts” with their own naming). **Ingestion** for Coinbase might involve pulling market data for all supported pairs (via REST or WebSocket feeds for trades/order book), and if futures are included, that data is retrieved from a different feed. **Execution** on Coinbase’s API will differ for spot vs futures mainly in endpoint and required parameters (futures might require leverage, etc.), but the workflows can be handled in parallel. 

*Key pattern:* Coinbase is expanding from a single asset class (crypto spot) to multi-product (spot + futures). They attempt to keep a unified user experience, but the API still distinguishes products. Our DAG design should treat Coinbase as one provider with possibly multiple asset-class-specific pipelines (spot vs futures), while keeping a consistent naming scheme.

### Alpaca – Unified Stocks and Crypto API 
Alpaca is a **developer-focused brokerage API** that started with equities and now also offers crypto trading. Notably, Alpaca provides a *unified API and account* for both asset classes ([Alpaca Launches Developer-Friendly Crypto Trading API](https://alpaca.markets/blog/alpaca-launches-crypto-trading/#:~:text=%2A%20Easy%20to%20use%2C%20developer,Trade%20cryptocurrencies%20direct%20via%20API)). Users can trade stocks and cryptocurrencies from the same account and through the same set of API endpoints. For example, Alpaca’s `/v2/orders` endpoint can be used to place orders for either stocks or crypto, and the asset is identified by its symbol. Their data APIs also cover both: a single **Assets API** returns available instruments, with a field indicating asset class (e.g. `asset_class: "crypto"` or `"us_equity"`) ([Crypto Spot Trading](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/crypto-trading#:~:text=%7B%20%22id%22%3A%20%22276e2673,false)). A query parameter can filter by asset class as needed ([Crypto Spot Trading](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/crypto-trading#:~:text=cURL)). This design means that **ingestion workflows** for Alpaca might be able to fetch both equity and crypto data in similar ways (though possibly with different frequencies or market hours), and **execution workflows** use the same endpoint with minor differences (crypto trades 24/7, equities only in market hours, etc.). 

Operational considerations: equities via Alpaca follow stock market schedules and regulations (e.g. no trading on weekends, trade halts, etc.), whereas crypto via Alpaca trades continuously. Alpaca’s unified API means the **code structure can be shared**, but one must still handle asset-specific logic (like no fractional shares for certain stocks vs crypto fractional trading, etc.). 

*Key pattern:* Alpaca uses a **function-first unified approach** in its API – the same functions/endpoints work for multiple asset classes, with asset type treated as a parameter or attribute ([Crypto Spot Trading](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/crypto-trading#:~:text=%7B%20%22id%22%3A%20%22276e2673,false)). This suggests that for our pipelines, grouping by function (ingestion, execution, etc.) with logic branching per asset type might be feasible for providers like Alpaca. However, maintaining clarity may still require separate DAGs or tasks for each asset category due to different schedules and data volumes.

### Other Providers and General Patterns 
Other trading providers and exchanges generally follow one of the above patterns. Traditional brokerages (like **TradeStation**, **TD Ameritrade**, etc.) often have unified multi-asset APIs (similar to IBKR). Many crypto exchanges (Kraken, FTX (defunct), etc.) separate spot and derivatives into distinct APIs or endpoints. Some brokers or data providers segment by region or regulatory entity (e.g. Binance vs Binance US as separate “providers”). The common theme is that **asset class differences often necessitate separate handling** at some level – whether via distinct endpoints or flags. For our DAG organization, this means we should be prepared to have distinct pipelines for each provider’s asset segments, but we want to do so in a consistent and discoverable way.

## Workflow Domain Considerations 
We have four broad workflow domains to support: **Ingestion, Execution, Transformation, and Analytics**. Each domain has different requirements and how they apply across providers/asset classes:

- **Ingestion:** This refers to collecting raw data – such as market price data, order book snapshots, trades, or reference data. The frequency and method of ingestion can vary by asset:
  - *Equities:* often ingested via daily batches or during market hours (e.g. end-of-day pricing, intraday streaming during 9:30-16:00). Providers like IBKR or Alpaca have endpoints for historical data and streaming feeds for real-time quotes. Market hours mean the DAG scheduling might be periodic (e.g. every minute during trading hours, or daily summary).
  - *Crypto:* ingested continuously (24/7). Exchanges like Binance and Coinbase provide continuous WebSocket streams and REST endpoints for historical and current data. Multiple parallel data streams (e.g. one per trading pair or a combined stream) might be needed. This can lead to separate ingestion tasks per exchange and per market type (for instance, Binance Spot ingestion vs Binance Futures ingestion).
  - *Options/Futures:* require ingesting not only prices but also contract reference data (expiry dates, strike prices, etc.). For example, an IBKR options ingestion might first fetch the option chain for an underlying then stream quotes. Futures on Binance might involve multiple expiry contracts or perpetuals with funding rates (additional data).
  
  Each provider’s ingestion will have its quirks (rate limits, required authentication for certain data, etc.). The DAGs handling ingestion need to accommodate these patterns. It often makes sense to **separate ingestion DAGs by provider and asset type** to manage different schedules and data structures. 

- **Execution:** This covers placing orders and managing trades. Execution workflows are highly sensitive to each provider’s API specifics:
  - IBKR, for instance, requires careful sequencing (one order at a time) ([Interactive Brokers | Documentation](https://docs.traderspost.io/docs/core-concepts/brokers/interactive-brokers#:~:text=Synchronous%20Trade%20Execution)) and has a confirmation flow; whereas a crypto exchange like Binance can handle many order requests but imposes request weight limits and may have different order types (e.g. Binance futures have leverage and position concepts). 
  - Some providers require maintaining sessions or handling auth renewal (IBKR’s TWS session vs others just using API keys). 
  - Execution DAGs typically run on trigger (for example, receiving a trading signal) or on schedule to manage open orders. They need to be distinct per provider because the act of placing an order on IBKR vs on Coinbase is fundamentally different. Even within one provider, different asset classes might use different endpoints (Coinbase spot order vs Coinbase futures order).
  
  For these reasons, we’ll likely have **execution DAGs per provider (and possibly per asset class)** to encapsulate the logic of translating a generic trade signal into provider-specific API calls.

- **Transformation:** After ingestion, raw data often needs to be processed – e.g. converting exchange-specific schemas into a normalized format, aggregating data across sources, computing technical indicators, etc. Transformation workflows could be either **provider-specific** (cleaning data from a single source), **asset-class-specific** (e.g. aggregating all crypto prices from multiple exchanges, or computing Greeks for options across providers), or even **global** (merging everything into a data warehouse). 
  - For example, an “equities transformation” process might merge data from IBKR and Alpaca equity feeds into one standardized schema for analysis. A “crypto transformation” might convert different exchange formats (Binance vs Coinbase) into a unified crypto market data table. 
  - There might also be transformations like calculating portfolio positions by consolidating execution data from multiple brokers.
  
  These tasks need consistent naming to indicate their scope. We should consider whether to organize them by asset class or keep them with providers. Often, transformations mark the point where data from multiple providers can converge (for consistency and analytics). It might make sense to group transformations by **asset domain** (since the logic to normalize stock data vs crypto data differs) rather than by source, or at least name them clearly to indicate both source and asset.

- **Analytics:** Analytics workflows are the end consumers of the data – examples include generating performance reports, running backtests, computing risk metrics, or real-time strategy analytics. These may cut across providers:
  - e.g. a **portfolio analytics** DAG might pull in executed trades from IBKR, Alpaca, and Binance to compute overall P&L.
  - an **exchange comparison** analytics might use data from multiple crypto exchanges to analyze arbitrage opportunities.
  - Some analytics could be asset-specific (like an options analytics DAG focusing on Greeks and volatility surfaces, using data perhaps from multiple brokers).
  
  Because analytics often combines data, we likely will not organize these strictly by provider. Instead, analytics DAGs might be grouped by function or topic. But we still want their naming to be systematic.

**Summary:** Each workflow domain imposes slightly different grouping needs. Ingestion and execution are **naturally segmented by provider and asset class** (due to API differences), whereas transformation and analytics might be organized by **asset domain or overall purpose** rather than provider. The challenge is to create a directory structure that accommodates all these without confusion.

## Designing a Scalable and Consistent DAG Structure 

Given the above analysis, we need a structure that is **intuitive, consistent, and scalable** along the axes of provider, asset class, and function. There are a few possible organizational philosophies:

- **Asset-class-first grouping:** Top-level separation by asset class (e.g. a directory for Equities, one for Crypto, one for Options, etc.), then subdivided by provider or function.
- **Provider-first grouping:** Top-level separation by provider (e.g. IBKR, Binance, Coinbase, Alpaca, …), then subdivided by asset class and/or function.
- **Function-first grouping:** Top-level separation by workflow function (Ingestion, Execution, Transformation, Analytics), then subdivided by provider and/or asset class.

Let’s evaluate these approaches for sustainability:

### Asset-Class-First Approach 
Organizing primarily by asset class could look like: 

```
dags/
   equities/
      ingestion/...
      execution/...
      transformation/...
      analytics/...
   crypto/
      ingestion/...
      execution/...
      ... etc.
   options/
      ...
   futures/
      ...
```

While this highlights asset-specific logic, it has drawbacks. Providers that span multiple classes (e.g. IBKR or Alpaca) would have their DAGs scattered across these folders. For example, IBKR-related DAGs would reside in `equities/`, `options/`, `futures/` sections simultaneously. This makes it harder to view everything related to a single provider integration in one place. It could also **duplicate effort** – each asset-class folder might end up with similar code structures for each provider, potentially reducing clarity on cross-asset commonalities. Consistency could suffer if each asset class team organizes things differently. Given that we want to avoid legacy team boundaries, an asset-class split might reinforce differences (e.g. separate “crypto team” vs “equities team” approaches). 

**Verdict:** Pure asset-class-first is likely not optimal for sustainability. It doesn’t mirror how providers actually deliver data (many providers serve multiple asset types via one API, as we saw with IBKR and Alpaca). It also complicates adding a new provider that offers multiple assets (one would have to create entries in several places). We can do better by grouping by provider or function.

### Provider-First Approach 
Organizing by provider would create a clear separation of concerns per integration. For example:

```
dags/
   IBKR/
       ibkr_ingestion_equities.py
       ibkr_ingestion_options.py
       ibkr_execution_orders.py
       ibkr_transformation_positions.py
       ...
   Binance/
       binance_ingestion_spot.py
       binance_ingestion_futures.py
       binance_execution_trades.py
       ...
   Coinbase/
       coinbase_ingestion_spot.py
       coinbase_ingestion_futures.py
       ...
   Alpaca/
       alpaca_ingestion_equities.py
       alpaca_ingestion_crypto.py
       ...
   (others...)
```

In this structure, each provider directory contains that provider’s DAGs, possibly named by function and asset. This makes it **easy to scale to new providers** – adding a new one just means creating a new folder with the standard set of pipeline files. It’s also intuitive for developers who are focusing on a particular integration; all related DAGs are in one place. 

To ensure consistency across providers, we’d enforce a naming convention within each provider folder. For instance, use the format `{provider}_{function}_{asset}.py` or `{provider}_{asset}_{function}.py`. In the example above, we prefixed with provider for clarity (since the file is already in a provider folder, that is optional, but keeping it can help when searching globally). We could also use subfolders per function inside each provider (e.g. `IBKR/ingestion/equities.py`), but that adds depth without much benefit if the number of files per provider is not too large. 

**Pros:** Provider-first aligns with how integration code is often written (each API integration is implemented separately). It avoids mixing code from different providers in one folder, reducing risk of confusion. It also isolates any provider-specific requirements (like special libraries or auth configurations). 

**Cons:** It might echo the “team-boundary” structure if each provider is owned by a different team – but as long as naming conventions are enforced, the *structure* can still be uniform. Another consideration is cross-provider workflows (especially in Transformation/Analytics): If we have a DAG that pulls data from multiple providers (say, combining Binance and Coinbase data), placing it under a single provider’s folder doesn’t make sense. We would need a place for **multi-provider or global** DAGs. That could be a separate folder (`dags/common` or a top-level `Analytics` folder) or we carefully decide to put such DAGs in the most relevant provider folder (not ideal). This indicates that provider-first might need to be combined with a secondary grouping for function or a special “common” area, which complicates the scheme slightly.

### Function-First Approach 
Function-first means we start by the workflow domain, creating top-level directories for *Ingestion, Execution, Transformation,* and *Analytics*. Within those, we organize by provider and asset. For instance:

```
dags/
   ingestion/
       ibkr_equities_ingestion.py
       ibkr_options_ingestion.py
       binance_spot_ingestion.py
       binance_futures_ingestion.py
       coinbase_spot_ingestion.py
       coinbase_futures_ingestion.py
       alpaca_equities_ingestion.py
       alpaca_crypto_ingestion.py
       ... 
   execution/
       ibkr_execution.py            (could include all IBKR order types or separate by asset if needed)
       binance_spot_execution.py
       binance_futures_execution.py
       coinbase_spot_execution.py
       alpaca_execution.py          (stock and crypto orders through same API)
       ... 
   transformation/
       equities_normalize.py        (combine or clean equity data from multiple sources)
       crypto_aggregate.py          (aggregate crypto market data from exchanges)
       ibkr_account_transform.py    (IBKR account data parse, if specific)
       ... 
   analytics/
       portfolio_performance.py     (across all assets and providers)
       trading_strategy_X_analysis.py
       crypto_vs_equity_correlations.py
       ...
```

In this structure, **workflow domains are clearly separated**. All ingestion DAGs live together, which makes it easy to ensure they run on appropriate schedules and to see if any provider is missing an ingestion pipeline. Likewise for execution – all trading execution DAGs are grouped, highlighting consistent patterns (e.g. perhaps all execution DAGs have a similar structure of tasks: receive signal -> place order -> log result). 

Crucially, we still incorporate provider and asset in the naming. We use file name prefixes or segments to indicate the provider (`ibkr`, `binance`, etc.) and possibly the asset class if one provider has multiple ingestion DAGs. For example, `binance_spot_ingestion.py` vs `binance_futures_ingestion.py`. This way, even within the ingestion folder, one can filter by provider easily (all files starting with “binance”) or by asset (all files containing “_futures”). 

**Pros:** Function-first inherently enforces **consistency across asset types and providers** for the same workflow stage. Developers working on ingestion can treat all ingestion pipelines together, encouraging standardized methods (perhaps a common template for ingestion DAGs) despite different sources. It also naturally accommodates cross-provider processes: e.g. a transformation DAG that takes data from multiple sources can live in the `transformation/` folder (perhaps named by its purpose, not tied to a single provider). We avoid the need for a separate “common” folder because the top-level function folders can house any DAG relevant to that function, including multi-provider ones. For example, an analytics DAG using all data can simply reside in `analytics/` with an appropriate descriptive name. 

Function-first is **future-proof** in that if we introduce a new workflow domain (say a “Monitoring” domain for operational checks), we can add a new top-level directory easily. It’s also flexible: if a new provider comes in, we add its ingestion and execution files to the respective folders. There’s no need to create a whole new section of the tree; the top-level categories remain fixed and known. 

**Cons:** The main trade-off is that code for a single provider is not in one place. A developer working on integrating a new provider will have to create DAGs in multiple folders (ingestion, execution, etc.). However, this is manageable with a good naming convention and possibly README documentation mapping out what to add. It also reflects reality: different types of pipelines may even run in different Airflow instances or have different owners, so grouping by function can align with those concerns. Another minor con is that as providers scale, the ingestion folder (for example) could contain many files. This can be mitigated by introducing a second-level grouping by provider within the function folder if needed (e.g. `dags/ingestion/binance/spot.py`) once the list grows large. Initially, a flat list with clear naming might suffice.

### Recommended Approach: Function-First Hierarchy with Clear Naming 
After weighing the options, the **function-first (workflow-first) approach** is the most sustainable and intuitive for the long term. This structure emphasizes consistency and shared patterns across the same stage of the pipeline, which helps avoid siloed designs. It is not bound to any specific team’s domain (breaking legacy notions of “the crypto DAGs vs the equities DAGs”) – instead, it encourages thinking of all ingestion together, all execution together, etc., with uniform conventions. 

We will implement this with careful naming to incorporate provider and asset class where necessary. The directory layout would be as follows:

- **Top-Level Folders:** `ingestion/`, `execution/`, `transformation/`, `analytics/` (one for each major workflow domain). We might also include others like `monitoring/` or `util/` in the future if needed, but these four cover the scope given.
- **Inside Ingestion:** One DAG Python file per provider per asset class (if a provider has multiple asset types to ingest). For example:  
  - `ingestion/ibkr_equities_ingestion.py` – DAG for ingesting IBKR equity market data (could handle both real-time and historical as tasks)  
  - `ingestion/ibkr_options_ingestion.py` – DAG for IBKR options data (since options might require different handling)  
  - `ingestion/binance_spot_ingestion.py` – DAG for Binance spot market data (all trading pairs or a subset as configured)  
  - `ingestion/binance_futures_ingestion.py` – DAG for Binance futures data (could be split further if needed by USD-M vs Coin-M, but that might be handled inside the DAG)  
  - `ingestion/coinbase_spot_ingestion.py` – DAG for Coinbase crypto prices  
  - `ingestion/coinbase_futures_ingestion.py` – DAG for Coinbase futures markets (if applicable)  
  - `ingestion/alpaca_equities_ingestion.py` – DAG for Alpaca stock data  
  - `ingestion/alpaca_crypto_ingestion.py` – DAG for Alpaca crypto data  
  - (Any new provider follows the pattern: `{provider}_{asset}_ingestion.py`).  
  These file names all share the pattern of including the provider name and asset class, making it easy to scan. Within each ingestion DAG, the tasks would be tailored to that provider’s API (calls, pagination, rate limiting, etc.), but because they all live together, we can ensure they follow a similar structure (e.g. all start by pulling a list of symbols then fetching data, etc., where applicable).

- **Inside Execution:** Likely one DAG per provider (or per provider per asset class if execution logic differs greatly):  
  - `execution/ibkr_execution.py` – handles placing orders on IBKR. (If IBKR’s order handling for different asset types is very different, we might split into `ibkr_equities_execution.py`, `ibkr_options_execution.py`, but it could also be one DAG with branching logic because IB’s interface is unified. We can decide based on complexity.)  
  - `execution/binance_spot_execution.py` and `execution/binance_futures_execution.py` – separate DAGs if we run distinct trading strategies on spot vs futures. If the use-case is just order routing, we might have a single `binance_trade_execution.py` that can route to the correct endpoint based on order details. But isolating spot vs futures might be clearer for operations.  
  - `execution/coinbase_execution.py` – Coinbase might allow both spot and futures orders in one place; we could keep one DAG and handle product type internally, or separate like `coinbase_spot_execution.py` and `coinbase_futures_execution.py` similar to Binance if needed.  
  - `execution/alpaca_execution.py` – Alpaca’s unified API means one DAG could handle both stock and crypto orders (the asset is just a parameter). We might not need two separate files here unless we want to enforce different schedules or risk controls for stock vs crypto orders. A single DAG can place orders for any asset given proper input.  

  Again, naming is consistent: `{provider}_{optional-asset}_execution.py`. The execution folder thus contains all automated trading pipelines. If there are cross-provider execution flows (for instance, a strategy that sends orders to multiple exchanges for arbitrage), those could be handled in a single DAG file with a generic name (e.g. `execution/arb_multi_exchange.py`), or broken into sub-tasks calling each provider’s API. Such a DAG fits naturally here as well.

- **Inside Transformation:** This is where we expect some DAGs to be **asset-class oriented** rather than provider-specific, since transformation often standardizes data across sources. We can organize this folder by naming conventions that reflect the output or process rather than provider:
  - `transformation/equities_data_normalization.py` – a DAG that takes raw equity data from various ingestions (perhaps stored in staging tables/files) and transforms it into a normalized format in a database. It might pull data from IBKR and Alpaca ingestions and combine them. 
  - `transformation/crypto_data_aggregation.py` – a DAG to aggregate and clean crypto data from Binance/Coinbase/etc. into unified OHLCV bars or a single feed. 
  - `transformation/ibkr_account_sync.py` – a DAG specifically to process IBKR account statements or position data into a common format. (This one is provider-specific, but it’s a transformation rather than direct ingestion – e.g. IBKR might drop daily trade confirm files that need parsing.)
  - `transformation/unified_positions.py` – a DAG that takes positions from all providers (IBKR, Binance, etc.) and merges into one portfolio view.
  
  We can also use subfolders here if we want to group by asset domain, but given the likely fewer number of transformation pipelines, a clear naming scheme might suffice. The key is that each file name indicates what it’s transforming. If provider-specific, include provider (like `ibkr_*`); if asset-broad, include the asset class or dataset name.

- **Inside Analytics:** These DAGs produce end results for users (reports, dashboards, metrics). We might organize them by purpose:
  - `analytics/portfolio_report.py` – generates consolidated portfolio reports across all investments.
  - `analytics/strategy_X_performance.py` – analyzes trades from a specific strategy (which might involve multiple providers if the strategy trades on several).
  - `analytics/market_monitor_crypto.py` – an analytic pipeline monitoring crypto market health (using data from multiple exchanges).
  - `analytics/latency_comparison.py` – for example, compares execution latency between providers (requires multi-provider data). 
  
  Since analytics can be highly custom, we likely just ensure their names are descriptive. If some analytics are scoped to one provider, we reflect that (e.g. `analytics/binance_fee_analysis.py` if we had one). But generally, many will be cross-cutting. The consistency to maintain here is mostly formatting and clarity rather than strict naming templates, as these are less standardized workflows.

By adopting this **function-first, provider-and-asset-aware naming** approach, we meet all the user’s goals:

- **Scalability:** We can easily add new providers. When adding, say, a new exchange “Kraken”, we know we should create `ingestion/kraken_spot_ingestion.py` (and perhaps futures, etc.), and `execution/kraken_execution.py`. The pattern is clear. The top-level structure doesn’t need to change; it can accommodate dozens of providers by adding files, or if needed, a subfolder per provider inside each function (should the list grow very long).
- **Support for all workflows:** The four primary folders ensure we segregate ingestion, execution, transformation, and analytics. This makes it easier to manage each domain (e.g. one could assign different Airflow schedules or different owners per folder if needed). We’re not forcing one workflow’s pattern onto another – e.g. ingestion DAGs might be scheduled often and have many sensor tasks, whereas execution DAGs might be event-driven – keeping them separate avoids any confusion.
- **Consistency across asset types:** No matter if it’s crypto spot, crypto futures, equities, or options, we treat the organization the same way. A crypto exchange’s ingestion DAG sits next to a stock broker’s ingestion DAG. The naming (provider + asset + function) is consistent, so it's immediately clear what each DAG is for. This prevents having completely different naming schemes for, say, crypto pipelines vs stock pipelines. It also encourages code re-use and standardization: e.g. all ingestion DAGs could use similar helper functions or follow similar step layouts, just adapted to each API. 
- **No legacy silos:** We explicitly avoid grouping by old team or system boundaries. For example, previously the “crypto team” might have kept all their DAGs in a separate folder. Now, crypto ingestion lives in the same folder as everything else’s ingestion. This fosters a unified engineering approach. It also surfaces any inconsistencies – if one provider’s pipelines are named or structured differently, it will be obvious next to others, prompting alignment. The **abstraction layer** between different providers can be implemented in code (helper libraries that present a common interface), but at the DAG organization level we treat them uniformly. As one expert suggested, an abstraction should cover the *“common denominator of all features”* across providers ([How do you organize, store and access data (market, trades ... - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/11i1lqa/how_do_you_organize_store_and_access_data_market/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,I)). In our case, the abstraction is evident in how we organize and name the pipelines as well.

## Proposed Naming Hierarchy and Examples 

Bringing it all together, here is the **optimal DAG directory and naming hierarchy** in a tree format with some examples:

```

│   └── ... (others as needed)
└── analytics/
    ├── portfolio_performance.py          # Analyze overall portfolio performance across providers
    ├── strategy_backtest_results.py      # Generate reports for a strategy's performance
    ├── market_volatility_monitor.py      # Monitor volatility (maybe separate by asset class internally)
    ├── cost_analysis_binance_vs_coinbase.py  # Example: compare trading costs between two exchanges
    └── ... (custom analytics tasks)
```

**Notes on this structure:**

- Each **provider** appears where relevant, but not as a top-level directory. This way, adding a provider doesn’t create an entire parallel hierarchy; it slots into the existing one. For instance, if we onboard “Kraken” (crypto exchange), we’d add `kraken_spot_ingestion.py` (and maybe `kraken_futures_ingestion.py`) under ingestion, and an execution DAG if we will trade on it. No other reorganization is needed.
- Each **asset class** is signaled in the file name. If tomorrow we add a new asset class (say **forex** trading via IBKR or **mutual funds** via some provider), we can reflect that in the name (e.g. `ibkr_forex_ingestion.py`). There’s no need to create a brand new folder; it’s just another file. This flat-but-descriptive naming is easier to maintain than separate nested levels for every asset type.
- We maintain the **function separation** clearly: ingestion vs execution vs transformation vs analytics code will not be mixed up. This also aids in assigning different configurations or runtime environments if needed (for example, ingestion DAGs might run on a schedule and be allowed to run for long durations to gather data, whereas execution DAGs might need low-latency trigger-based runs – separating them means we could even deploy them to different worker pools).
- The naming hierarchy is **future-proof** in that it is unlikely to need structural changes as we grow:
  - If a new workflow domain arises (for example, a “compliance” workflow to check regulatory reports), we can add `dags/compliance/` and put relevant DAGs there.
  - If one of the categories becomes very crowded (e.g. dozens of ingestion files), we have the option to introduce one more level of folders by provider *within* that category. For instance, `dags/ingestion/binance/spot.py, futures.py` if needed. This is an incremental change that doesn’t break the overall philosophy.
  - The simplicity of the structure makes it easy for new team members to understand. They can immediately see the breakdown by function. Searching for all DAGs related to a provider or asset is trivial via name patterns.

- We should document the naming convention clearly: **use lowercase provider names**, common abbreviations (e.g. `ibkr` for Interactive Brokers, not mix `IB` in some places and `IBKR` in others), and consistent asset class terms (`equities` vs `stocks` – choose one; we used `equities` for formality, `crypto` vs `spot` – we clarify by context, using `crypto` for Alpaca since it’s crypto in general, but `spot` for exchanges like Binance to distinguish from futures). Consistency in these terms is crucial. For example, “futures” should be used universally for futures/perpetual swaps, instead of sometimes calling them “derivatives” in one file and “futures” in another.

### Why Function/Workflow-First is Most Sustainable 
This function-first model is sustainable because it mirrors a form of **separation of concerns** that is stable over time. The set of high-level workflows (ingest, execute, transform, analyze) is relatively fixed and understood in the industry. Asset classes and providers, on the other hand, are numerous and evolving. By structuring primarily by the stable dimension (the *function*), we create a solid backbone. Then we use naming to incorporate the variable dimensions (provider, asset). This way, if providers or assets change (new ones added, old ones removed), it’s just a matter of adding or deleting files – it doesn’t upset the overall layout.

Furthermore, a workflow-first approach facilitates creating an **abstraction layer in code**. For example, we might develop a common interface for “market data ingestion” that each provider-specific DAG implements in its own way. Placing all ingestion DAGs together allows developers to enforce that abstraction and easily compare implementations. This resonates with advice from the algorithmic trading community about designing systems with a common abstraction over different brokers/exchanges ([How do you organize, store and access data (market, trades ... - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/11i1lqa/how_do_you_organize_store_and_access_data_market/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,I)). In our case, the abstraction is evident in how we organize and name the pipelines as well.

### Example Use Case Walk-Through 
To illustrate the intuitiveness, consider a scenario: We want to find the DAG that ingests crypto prices from Coinbase. In the proposed scheme, one would naturally go to `dags/ingestion/` and see `coinbase_spot_ingestion.py` (since Coinbase’s main asset is spot crypto). The name is self-explanatory. Alternatively, if asked “what ingestion do we have for Binance?”, a simple glance at the ingestion folder (or a quick search for “binance” in that folder) shows both spot and futures ingestion files. There is no ambiguity or need to hunt through separate trees. 

Now, suppose we want to add support for **options trading on Binance** (imagine Binance starts offering options). Under our model, we’d add `binance_options_ingestion.py` to handle option market data, and perhaps integrate it accordingly, and an execution DAG if trading them. We don’t need to restructure anything else; it slots in alphabetically among ingestion DAGs. Similarly, if we decided to stop using Alpaca for crypto, we could remove `alpaca_crypto_ingestion.py` and `alpaca_execution.py` (or repurpose them), without leaving empty directories.

### Handling Cross-Provider Workflows 
One might wonder: if an analytics DAG uses data from multiple sources, should it be under one of those provider’s names? In our scheme, the answer is no – it resides in the `analytics/` folder with a descriptive name. For example, `analytics/cost_analysis_binance_vs_coinbase.py` clearly indicates it involves Binance and Coinbase comparison. We don’t tuck it under `binance/` or `coinbase/` specifically. The function-first approach inherently handles multi-provider or multi-asset processes by placing them in the domain category. This is a significant advantage over a provider-first structure where one might struggle to decide where a multi-provider DAG goes. 

If we had gone with provider-first, we might have needed a special `common/` directory for such cases, which is extra complexity. With function-first, **the domain is the unifier** – any task that belongs to “analytics” goes in that folder, regardless of how many providers it touches.

## Conclusion 
By analyzing major providers, we found that data is typically organized either in a unified way with type identifiers (IBKR, Alpaca) or separated by product type (Binance, Coinbase to an extent). We also considered the needs of different workflow stages. Our **proposed DAG organization** is a balanced approach: **Function-first top-level grouping**, with **provider and asset class indicated in file names**. This structure is robust against growth in providers and assets and ensures intuitive navigation and consistency. It avoids legacy siloing by forcing all pipelines of a given type to live together and follow the same patterns.

In summary, we recommend creating the directories **Ingestion, Execution, Transformation, Analytics** (and any future workflows) under the DAGs folder. Within each, name DAG files as `{provider}_{asset}_{function}.py` (where function can be omitted in name if redundant with folder). This yields a clean, scalable hierarchy. New additions naturally fit in, and developers can quickly find what they need. By keeping asset-class and provider visible in naming, we maintain clarity on what each pipeline does, while the standardized layout across all asset types ensures a **future-proof, unified architecture** for the trading platform’s data pipelines.
