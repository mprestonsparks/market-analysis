# Session Checkpoint â€“ 2025-04-22

## Status Summary

### Airflow DAG Import Test
- Implemented `tests/airflow_stubs.py` to provide lightweight stubs for `airflow.DAG` and `airflow.providers.docker.operators.docker.DockerOperator`.
- Patched `tests/test_dag_import.py` to monkeypatch these stubs during test runs, allowing DAG files to be imported in CI/unit tests without triggering Airflow runtime bootstrapping.
- This approach prevents sys.exit() and import-time failures, making DAG syntax validation possible in local/dev/CI environments.

### Remaining Issues
- Several unrelated test failures remain in the main test suite, mostly due to missing data or test fixture issues (see previous test logs).
- No major blockers remain for DAG import validation or Airflow integration.

## Next Steps for Resuming Work
1. Run `pytest tests/test_dag_import.py` to verify all DAGs import cleanly using the stubs.
2. Address remaining test failures in the main suite (see `pytest tests` results for details).
3. Continue with TO-DOs: provider factory tests, documentation, and Airflow integration improvements.

## Commit Reference
- All changes up to this checkpoint are ready to be committed and pushed to `main` in both `market-analysis` and `airflow-hub` repos.

# How to Resume
- Review this file and the latest commit in `main`.
- Check `tests/airflow_stubs.py` and `tests/test_dag_import.py` for the stub/monkeypatching approach.
- Continue with main test suite fixes and Airflow development as needed.
